## Measuring the aggregate economy 

Economists use what are called aggregate statistics to describe the economy as a whole (known as the aggregate economy, meaning simply the sum of its parts brought together)

--

**National accounts**:  system used to measure overall output and expenditure in a country.

--

.left-column[

Three equivalent ways to measure GDP:

1. Total spending on domestic products

2. Total domestic production (measured as value added)

3. Total domestic income

## Measuring the aggregate economy 

### Example: GDP in a 3-industry economy

.pull-left[
Industries involved:

1.	Raw cotton → sells cotton for $50

2.	Cloth → buys cotton, sells cloth for $80

3.	Shirt → buys cloth, sells shirt for $100

]

--

.pull-right[

- **GDP via final expenditure:**
 - = $100 (value of shirts sold to consumers)

- **GDP via value added:**
  - Cotton: $50
	-	Cloth: $80 − $50 = $30
	-	Shirt: $100 − $80 = $20
  - **Total: $100**
  
- **GDP via income:**
  - = Wages + Profits across all industries
  - = Total value added = $100
  
]

---
## Exports, imports, and government

- How do we account for international transactions?
 e.g. foreign production is domestic consumption (imports); or domestic production is foreign consumption (exports)
 
--

  - We include exports and exclude imports, so that GDP includes value added, income from, or consumption of, domestic production.
  
--

- How do we incorporate government?

--

  - Treat it as another producer – public services are “bought” via taxes
  
--
  
  - Assume that cost of production captures the value added

## Components of GDP

`$$GDP = Y$$`

---
## Components of GDP

`$$GDP = Y = C + I + G + X – M$$`
--

- **Consumption (C)**: Expenditure on consumer goods and services (durable, non-durable, intangible)

--

- **Investment (I)**: Expenditure on newly produced capital goods (incl. equipment, buildings, and inventories = unsold output) 

--

- **Government spending (G)**: Government expenditure on goods and services (excluding transfers to avoid double-counting)

--

- **Net exports (trade balance)** = **Exports (X)** minus **imports (M)**

--

| | US | Eurozone | China |
|-------------------------|
| Consumption (C)	| 68.4%	| 55.9%	| 37.3% |
| Government spending (G)	| 15.1%	| 21.1%	| 14.1% |
| Investment (I)	| 19.1%	| 19.5%	| 47.3% |
| Change in inventories	 | 0.4%	 | 0.0%	 | 2.0% |
| Exports (X)	| 13.6%	| 43.9%	| 26.2% |
| Imports (M)	| 16.6%	| 40.5%	| 23.8% |

## Components of GDP

`$$GDP = Y = C + I + G + X – M$$`

- **Consumption (C)**: Expenditure on consumer goods and services (durable, non-durable, intangible)

- **Government spending (G)**: Government expenditure on goods and services (excluding transfers to avoid double-counting)

- **Net exports (trade balance)** = **Exports (X)** minus **imports (M)**


$$ \Delta GDP \% = \Delta Y \% = \Delta C \% \cdot \frac{C}{Y} + \Delta I \% \cdot \frac{I}{Y}  + \Delta G \% \cdot \frac{G}{Y}  + \Delta NE \% \cdot \frac{NE}{Y} $$

**Shock**: an unexpected event which causes GDP to fluctuate.

--

Two kinds of shocks:
--
 **Household shocks**

--
 and **Economy-wide shocks**.

--
 How to deal with them?

--

.pull-left[

**Household shocks**

1) **Self-insurance** – saving and borrowing. Other households are not involved. 

2) **Co-insurance** – support from social network or government.

This reflects that households prefer to **smooth their consumption**, and that they are (to a degree) **altruistic**.

]

--

.pull-right[

**Economy-wide shocks**

Co-insurance is less effective if the bad shock hits everyone at the same time.

But co-insurance is even more necessary.

In farming economies of the past that were based in volatile climates, people practised co-insurance based on **trust, reciprocity, and altruism**.

## Consumption over time
]

Trade-off between consuming goods now and later: **opportunity cost** of having more goods now is having fewer goods later.

--

Borrowing and lending allow us to rearrange our capacity to buy goods and services across time.

--

**Repayment**: principal + interest.

--

**Interest rate (r)**: The price of bringing some buying power forward in time. `\(r = \frac{repaument}{principal} - 1\)` 

--

**(1+r)**: Tradeoff between current and future consumption (MRT)

--

.center[
Example: Julia, principal = 91 and repayment = 100
]


.pull-left[

`$$repayment = 91 + 91\cdot r = 91 \cdot (1 + r) \approx 100$$`
]

.pull-right[

`$$r = \frac{100}{91} - 1  \approx 1.10 - 1 = .10 = 10\%$$`

### Borrowing

&lt;img src="imgs/f10-2-a.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

Julia does not have money now, but knows that in the next period (later) she will have $100 from her paycheck or harvest.

---
### Borrowing

&lt;img src="imgs/f10-2-b.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

Julia could borrow 91 now and promise to pay the lender the 100 that she will have later. The interest rate would be 10%.

---
### Borrowing

&lt;img src="imgs/f10-2-b.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

Julia could borrow 91 now and promise to pay the lender the 100 that she will have later. The interest rate would be 10%.

---
### Borrowing

&lt;img src="imgs/f10-2-c.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

At the same interest rate (10%), she could also borrow 70 to spend now, and repay 77 at the end of the year. In that case she would have 23 to spend next year.

---
### Borrowing

&lt;img src="imgs/f10-2-d.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

She could also borrow 30 to spend now, and repay 33 at the end of the year. In that case she would have 67 to spend next year.

---
### Borrowing

&lt;img src="imgs/f10-2-e.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

The boundary of Julia’s feasible set is her feasible frontier, shown for the interest rate of 10%.

---
### Borrowing

&lt;img src="imgs/f10-2-f.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

Juila can borrow now and choose any combination on her feasible frontier.

---
### Borrowing

&lt;img src="imgs/f10-2-g.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

If, instead of 10%, the interest rate is 78%, Julia can only borrow a maximum of $56 now.

---
### Borrowing

&lt;img src="imgs/f10-2-h.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

The feasible set with the interest rate of 78% is the dark shaded area, while the feasible set with an interest rate of 10% is the dark shaded area plus the light shaded area.


---
### Preferences for consumption

How much consumption we bring forward depends on how impatient we are.
--

How much consumption an individual will bring forward depends on:  

- **consumption smoothing**: changing consumption across time (consuming a lot in one period and little in the other).
- **impatience**
  - **Myopia (short-sightedness)**: People experience the present satisfaction more strongly than the same satisfaction later
  - **Prudence**: People know that they may not be around in the future, and so they want to consume now
  
--

**Diminishing marginal returns to consumption**  the value to the individual of an additional unit of consumption in a given period declines the more that is consumed.

---
### Consumption smoothing

&lt;img src="imgs/f10-3-a.png" width="55%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

The dashed line shows the combinations of consumption now and consumption later from which Julia can choose.

---
### Consumption smoothing

&lt;img src="imgs/f10-3-b.png" width="55%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

Julia’s IC is bowed toward the origin as a consequence of diminishing marginal returns to consumption in each period: the more goods she has in the present, the less she values an additional one now relative to more in the future. 

---
### Consumption smoothing

&lt;img src="imgs/f10-3-c.png" width="55%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

The MRS at C is high (the slope of her indifference curve is steep): Julia has little consumption now and a lot later, so diminishing marginal returns mean that she would like to move some consumption to the present.

---
### Consumption smoothing

&lt;img src="imgs/f10-3-c.png" width="55%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

The MRS at E is low: She has a lot of consumption now and less later, so diminishing marginal returns mean that she would like to move some consumption to the future.

---
### Consumption smoothing

&lt;img src="imgs/f10-3-d.png" width="55%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

MRS is falling as we move along the indifference curve from C to E: the slope is steeper at C than at E.

---
### Consumption smoothing

&lt;img src="imgs/f10-3-e.png" width="55%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

Julia will choose point F. It is on the highest attainable indifference curve. She prefers to smooth consumption between now and later.

---
### Consumption smoothing: Optimal decision-making

**Discount rate** `\((\rho)\)`: a measure of a person's impatience.

--
  - Consumption smoothing
  - Pure impatience 
  
--

Individual borrows at the point where discount rate = interest rate

--

$$ \textit{slope of the indifference curve (MRS)} = \textit{slope of the feasible frontier (MRT)}$$

--

.pull-left[
`$$MRS = 1 + \rho$$`
]

.pull-right[
`$$MRT = 1 + r$$`
]

--

$$ MRS = MRT \iff 1 + \rho = 1 + r \iff \rho = r $$

---
### Consumption smoothing: Optimal decision-making

&lt;img src="imgs/f10-4-a.png" width="52.25%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

Julia wishes to get to the highest indifference curve but is limited by her feasible frontier.

---
### Consumption smoothing: Optimal decision-making

&lt;img src="imgs/f10-4-b.png" width="52.25%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

When the interest rate is 10%, the highest attainable indifference curve will be the one that is tangent to the feasible frontier.

---
### Consumption smoothing: Optimal decision-making


&lt;img src="imgs/f10-4-c.png" width="52.25%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

Point E: MRS = MRT.

---
### Consumption smoothing: Optimal decision-making

&lt;img src="imgs/f10-4-d.png" width="52.25%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

At point F, her discount rate, `\(\rho\)`, exceeds `\(r\)`, the interest rate, so she would like to bring consumption forward in time. 

---
### Consumption smoothing: Optimal decision-making

&lt;img src="imgs/f10-4-e.png" width="52.25%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

If the interest rate at which she can borrow increases, the feasible set gets smaller.

---
### Consumption smoothing: Optimal decision-making

&lt;img src="imgs/f10-4-f.png" width="52.25%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

The best Julia can do now is to borrow less (35 instead of 58), as shown by point G.

## Smoothing Consumption

&lt;img src="imgs/f13-10-b.png" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

This is the red line. It is smooth (flat) from the point at which the individual first gets a job.

---
## Smoothing Consumption


&lt;img src="imgs/f13-10-c.png" width="65%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

At this time income is low. The individual saves and repays the debt when older and earning more, and finally runs down savings after retirement, when income falls again.

---
## Smoothing Consumption


&lt;img src="imgs/f13-10-c.png" width="65%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

**Consumption smoothing is a basic source of stabilisation in an economy.** They think about what might happen to their income in the future, and they save and borrow to smooth the bumps in income. This is self-insurance.

Optimal consumption at A″: the household prefers to smooth consumption, consuming c′ in both periods. The household borrows c′ − y′ now and repays (1 + r)(c′ − y′) next period following the shock.

**Weakness of will** – inability to commit to beneficial future plans.


When a consumption-smoothing household receives news of the imminent fall in income, it immediately starts saving to supplement consumption when income falls.

## Investment
]

Firms don’t have preferences for smoothing like households.
--
 They adjust investment plans to both temporary and permanent shocks, to maximise their profits.  

--

**Capacity utilisation**: A measure of the extent to which a firm, industry, or entire economy is producing as much as the stock of its capital goods and current knowledge would allow.

## Investment and the aggregate economy
]

- The benefits of coordinating investment makes cycles self-reinforcing.

--

- Firms respond positively to the growth of demand in the economy. **This is why investment is more volatile than GDP.**

--

  - Government spending is less volatile than investment (does not depend on business confidence)
  
  - Exports depend on demand from other countries, so will fluctuate according to the business cycles of major export markets.

.pull-left[

**Consumer Price Index (CPI)**

Measures the general level of prices that consumers have to pay for goods and services, including consumption taxes

- Based on a representative bundle of consumer goods – “cost of living”
- Common measure of inflation = change in CPI 

]

.pull-left[

**GDP deflator**

A measure of the level of prices for domestically produced output (ratio of nominal to real GDP) 

- Tracks prices of components of GDP (C, I, G, NX)
- Allows GDP to be compared across countries and over time

## Summary
]

--

1) Economic growth is not a smooth process – the economy goes through a business cycle

--

  - Households try to smooth their consumption over the business cycle (problem: credit constraints)
  - Investment is more volatile than GDP; the outcome of a self-reinforcing coordination game
  -  Inflation moves with the business cycle
  
--

2) System of national accounts to measure the economy

  - GDP = C + I + G + X – M
  - Measuring GDP as income, spending, production
