## Labour markets and unemployment


The upcoming **three** classes we will study the interaction between firms, markets, the division of labour, and unemployment.

--

- **Unit 6.** The firm: Owners, managers, and employers

--

- **Unit 7.** The firm and its customers

--

- **Unit 9.** The labour market: Wages, profits, and unemployment

--

### Going from the small scale social interactions to the general picture

### 1. Employment rents

Choose the correct answer(s):

Maria earns $12 per hour in her current job and works 35 hours a week. Her disutility of effort is equivalent to a cost of $2 per hour of work. If she loses her job, she will receive unemployment benefit equivalent to $6 per hour. Additionally, being unemployed has psychological and social costs equivalent to $1 per hour. Then:


a) The employment rent per hour is $3.

b) Maria’s reservation wage is $6 per hour.

c) Maria’s employment rent if she can get another job with the same wage rate after 44 weeks of being unemployed is $6,160.

d) Maria’s employment rent if she can only get a job at a lower wage rate after 44 weeks of being unemployed is more than $7,700.


---
### 2. Employee's best response curve

Choose the correct answer(s):

.pull-left[
&lt;img src="imgs/figure-06-04-g.png" width="350%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
]

.pull-right[

a) If the expected unemployment duration increased to 50 weeks, Maria’s best response to a wage of $12 would be an effort level above 0.5.

b) If the unemployment benefit was reduced, then Maria’s reservation wage would be higher than $6.

c) Over the range of wages shown in the figure, Maria would never exert the maximum possible effort per hour.

d) Increasing effort from 0.5 to 0.6 requires a bigger wage increase than increasing effort from 0.8 to 0.9.
]

---
### 3. Labour discipline model

Suppose that Maria’s reservation wage is `\(w_r\)` (a positive constant) and her best response function is:

$$ E(w) = k(w-w_r)^\alpha \quad (w &gt; w_r)$$
where the terms `\(k &gt; 0\)` and `\(0 &lt; \alpha &lt; 1\)` are constants.

Under the labour discipline model, what is the efficiency wage? What is the effort that Maria will put into work with such wage?

---
### 4. Firm's cost curves

a) The profit level at A is 500.

b) The profit level at B is 150.

c) The price at C is 50.

d) The price at B is 36.
]

---
### 5. Ealsticities

Choose the correct answer(s):

A shop sells 20 hats per week at 10 each. When it increases the price to 12, the number of hats sold falls to 15 per week. Which of the following statements are correct?

a) When the price increases from 10 to 12, demand increases by 25%.

b) A 20% increase in the price causes a 25% fall in demand.

c) The demand for hats is inelastic.

d) The elasticity of demand is approximately 1.25.

## Understanding the firm

--

Goods are usually produced not in the same place they are consumed.
--
 Where does your t-shirt or shirt come from? 
--
 Why?
--

- Firms outsource or offshore production to countries  where wages are lower.

Model how wages are determined when there are conflicts of interest between employers and employees, and look at what this means for the sharing of the mutual gains that arise from cooperation in a firm.

---
## Unit 6. The firm: Owners, managers, and employees

- Firms are major actors in the economy.

--

- Analyse how firms differ from markets.

--

- Use a model of interactions within the firm to explain how wages are determined, and how this influences unemployment.

--

- Explore the problem of incomplete contracts and hidden actions.

# Firms, markets, and the division of labour

---
## Firms

**Firm:** a business organization which

--

.pull-left[
- Employs people

- Purchases inputs to produce market goods and services

- Sets prices greater than the cost of production

&gt; “The firm in a capitalist economy is a miniature, privately owned, centrally planned economy.” R. Coase

&lt;img src="imgs/dunder-mifflin.webp" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
]


---
## Firms vs. markets

In a capitalist economy, the division of labour is coordinated in two ways: firms and markets.

--

Coordination within firm differs from coordination via markets:

--

- concentration of economic power in the hands of the owners/managers allows them to issue commands to workers

--

- power is decentralized in markets, so decisions are autonomous and voluntary

--

---
## Structure of a firm

- Owners decide on long-term strategy

--

- Managers implement their decisions by assigning tasks to workers and monitoring them

--

**Managers ≠ owners**

--

**Separation of ownership and control:** when managers decide on the use of other people’s funds.

--

&lt;img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/YwpylUojkfOZa/giphy.gif" width="50%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
## Contracts and relationships

- Firms and markets differ in the contracts that form the basis of exchange.

--

**Contract:**
--
 a legal document or understanding that specifies a set of actions that parties to the contract must undertake.
 
--

- Contracts for **products** sold in markets **permanently transfer ownership** of the good from the seller to the buyer. 

--

- Contracts for **labour** **temporarily transfer authority** over a person’s activities from the employee to the manager or owner.


&lt;img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/3orif2JK8DsUSxMShW/giphy.gif" width="35%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;


---
## Contracts and relationships


Unlike in markets, relationships within a firm may extend over a long period of time.

--

- creation of network of colleagues
- acquisition of skills necessary for the job

--

These skills, networks, and friendships are firm-specific assets.
--
  They are valuable only while the worker remains employed in a particular firm. When the relationship ends, value is lost to both sides.


&lt;img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/l0MYt5jPR6QX5pnqM/giphy.gif" width="50%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;


---
## Asymmetric information

--

Owners or managers do not always know what their subordinates know or do, not all of their directions or commands are necessarily carried out.

--

---

&lt;img src="imgs/figure-06-01-c.svg" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;


---
## Conflict and aligning interests

The firm’s profits legally belong to the people who own the firm’s assets.

--

- Managers’ actions have impact on profits

--

- but if profits increase thanks to managers’ work, they will not automatically benefit. 

--


This creates a conflict of interest between managers and owners.

&lt;img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/5zoHyCdbtm8feNkIxJ/giphy.gif" width="30%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

--

To solve the conflict of interest between managers and owners:

- link the managers’ pay to the performance of the company’s share price

- monitor the managers’ performance

---
## Incomplete Contracts

Hiring employees is different from buying other goods and services. 
--
 The contract between a firm and its employees is incomplete:

--

- some tasks depend on future (unknown) events

--

- some aspects of the job are difficult to measure and base wages on e.g. effort

--

Incomplete contract does not specify, in an enforceable way, every aspect of the exchange that affects the interests of parties.

--

## Workers’ effort

If firms can’t directly measure effort, why do workers work hard?

--

- work ethic
- feelings of responsibility 
- to reciprocate a feeling of gratitude for good working conditions
- benefits for measurable output

]

---
## Employment Rents

Employees fear getting fired when they are paid more than their **reservation option** = they receive employment rent.

--

**Employment rent** = cost of job loss,
--
  which includes:

--

- Lost income while searching for a job

--

- Costs required to start a new job e.g. relocation

--

- Loss of non-wage benefits e.g. medical insurance

--

- Social costs (stigma of being unemployed)

---

# Determinants of the employment rent
]

---
## Employment rent exmaple


Maria, an employee earning $12 an hour for 35-hour working week.

--

- The pay that she gets: which is something she values.

- How hard she works: she would like to do no more work than is necessary.

--

- Working this hard is equivalent to a cost of $2 per hour to Maria.

--


`$$\textit{net utility per hour} = wage -  \textit{disutility of effort per hour} = 10$$`

---

&lt;img src="imgs/figure-06-02-a.svg" width="85%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

Maria’s hourly wage, is $12. Looking ahead from now (taken as time 0), she will continue to receive this wage for the foreseeable future if she keeps her job.

---

&lt;img src="imgs/figure-06-02-b.svg" width="85%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

Maria’s current effort level is 0.5: she pursues non-work activities for half of the time on the job. Working this hard is equivalent to a cost of $2 per hour to Maria.

---

&lt;img src="imgs/figure-06-02-c.svg" width="85%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

The difference between her wage and disutility of effort is the economic rent per hour that she receives while employed.

---

&lt;img src="imgs/figure-06-02-d.svg" width="85%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

If instead Maria were to lose her job at time 0, she would no longer receive her wages. This unfortunate state would persist as long as she remains unemployed.

---

&lt;img src="imgs/figure-06-02-e.svg" width="85%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

The expected duration of unemployment is 44 weeks, where she would have worked 35 hours per week. That is how long she will remain without pay (and without the disutility of working).

---

&lt;img src="imgs/figure-06-02-f.svg" width="85%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

Maria expects to find another job at the same wage after 44 weeks.

$$\textit{total employment rent} = \textit{\$10 per hour} \times \textit{1,540 hours} = \textit{\$15,400}$$

---

&lt;img src="imgs/figure-06-02-g.svg" width="85%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

The shaded area is her total cost of job loss from the spell of unemployment, that is, her employment rent.

---

What about unemployment benefits? How do they change reservation wages?

--

&lt;img src="imgs/figure-06-03.svg" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

$$\textit{total employment rent} = \textit{\$4 per hour} \times \textit{1,540 hours} = \textit{\$6,160}$$

# Work and wages: The labour discipline model
]

---
## Wages and Effort


The employer cannot directly measure the worker’s effort.

--

Large employment rent
--
 → large cost of job loss
--
 →  worker puts in more effort to reduce chance of getting fired

--

One way to increase the cost of job loss is for the firm to raise wages.

--

Represent this social interaction in the firm as a game played by the owners (through their managers) and the employees.

--
## Labour Discipline Model


---
## Labour Discipline Model

--

Model the social interaction in the firm played by owners (through managers) and the employees.

--

1. **The employer chooses a wage.** As long as the worker works hard enough, she will keep her job at the offered wage. 

--

2. **The worker chooses a level of work effort.**  Taking into account the costs of losing her job if she does not provide enough effort.

--

**Payoffs:**

--

- **Firm:** `\(profit = \textit{worker's output} – wage\)`
- **Worker:** `\(\textit{employment rent}\)`

---
### Employee’s best response curve:
--

&lt;img src="imgs/figure-06-04-a.svg" width="75%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

Effort per hour, measured on the vertical axis, varies between zero and one.


---

### Employee’s best response curve:

&lt;img src="imgs/figure-06-04-b.svg" width="75%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

If Maria is paid 6 she does not care if she loses her job because 6 is her reservation wage. This is why she provides no effort at a  6 wage. If she is paid more, she provides more effort.


---

### Employee’s best response curve:

&lt;img src="imgs/figure-06-04-c.svg" width="75%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

The upward-sloping curve shows how much effort she puts in for each value of the hourly wage on the horizontal axis.

---

### Employee’s best response curve:

&lt;img src="imgs/figure-06-04-d.svg" width="75%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

When the wage is low, the best response curve is steep: a small wage increase raises effort by a substantial amount.


---

### Employee’s best response curve:

&lt;img src="imgs/figure-06-04-e.svg" width="75%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

At higher levels of wages, however, increases in wages have a smaller effect on effort.

---

### Employee’s best response curve:

&lt;img src="imgs/figure-06-04-f.svg" width="75%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

The best response curve is the frontier of the employer’s feasible set of combinations of wages and effort that it gets from its employees.

---

### Employee’s best response curve:

&lt;img src="imgs/figure-06-04-g.svg" width="75%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

The slope of the best response curve is the employer’s marginal rate of transformation of higher wages into more worker effort.

---
.center2[
# Wages, effort, and profits in the labour discipline model
]

---
## Firms’s best response

Maria has bargaining power because she can always walk away.

--

The best the owner can do is to determine the conditions under which she makes that choice.

--
 
The owners and managers know that they cannot get Maria to provide more effort than is given by the best response curve.

--

Recall: to maximize profits, firms want to minimize the costs of production. In particular, they want to pay the lowest possible price for inputs.

--

The wage, `\(w\)`, is the cost to the employer of an hour of a worker’s time. 

--

But what matters for production is not how many hours Maria provides, but how many units of effort: effort is the input to the production process.

In general, if she provides e units of effort per hour, the cost of a unit of effort is `\(w/e\)`.

---
### Firms’s best response: Isocost line

--

&lt;img src="imgs/figure-06-05-a.svg" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

If w = 10 and e = 0.45, e/w = 0.045. At every point on this line the ratio of effort to wages is the same. The cost of a unit of effort is w/e = 22.22.


---

### Firms’s best response: Isocost line

&lt;img src="imgs/figure-06-05-b.svg" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

The line slopes upward because a higher effort level must be accompanied by a higher wage for the e/w ratio to remain unchanged. The slope is equal to e/w = 0.045, the number of units of effort per dollar.

---

### Firms’s best response: Isocost line

&lt;img src="imgs/figure-06-05-c.svg" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

On an isocost line, the slope is e/w, but the cost of effort is w/e. The steeper line has a lower cost of effort, and the flatter line has a higher cost of effort.

---

### Firms’s best response: Isocost line

&lt;img src="imgs/figure-06-05-d.svg" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

A steeper line means lower cost of effort and hence higher profits for the employer. On the steepest isocost line he gets 0.7 units of effort for a wage of 10 (at B) so the cost of effort is 10/0.7 = 14.29 per unit. On the middle line he only gets 0.45 units of effort at this wage, so the cost of effort is 22.22, and profits are lower.

---

### Firms’s best response: Isocost line

&lt;img src="imgs/figure-06-05-e.svg" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

The employer is indifferent between points on an isocost line. Like other indifference curves, the slope of the effort isocost line is the marginal rate of substitution: the rate at which the employer is willing to increase wages to get higher effort.

---
### Determining wages:

--

&lt;img src="imgs/figure-06-06-a.svg" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

The owner wants to obtain effort at the lowest cost: seek to get onto the steepest isocost line possible. Since he cannot dictate the level of effort, he has to pick some point on the worker’s best response curve.

---
### Determining wages:

&lt;img src="imgs/figure-06-06-b.svg" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

It is clear that by paying more the owner will benefit from a lower wage-effort ratio.

---
### Determining wages:

&lt;img src="imgs/figure-06-06-c.svg" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

The best he can do is the isocost line that is just touching (tangent to) the worker’s best response curve.

---
### Determining wages:

&lt;img src="imgs/figure-06-06-d.svg" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

The MRS (the slope of the isocost line for effort) is equal to the MRT of higher wages into greater effort (the slope of the best response function)

---
### Determining wages:

&lt;img src="imgs/figure-06-06-e.svg" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

Points on steeper isocosts, such as Point B, would have lower costs for the employer but are infeasible.

---
### Determining wages:

&lt;img src="imgs/figure-06-06-f.svg" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

Therefore $12 is the hourly wage that the employer should set to minimize costs and maximize profits.

---

Profits are maximised at the steepest isocost line, subject to the worker’s best response curve.

--

### Mathematicallly

`\(H\)` = hours per week; `\(\quad\)` `\(e\)` = effort; `\(\quad\)` `\(N\)` = hours of productive work
--
 `\(\quad \Rightarrow N = eH\)`

--

.pull-left[

**Firm:** 

$$\Pi = p \cdot f(eH) - wH $$

]

.pull-right[

**Employee:** 

$$e = E(w) $$

where `\(E'(w) &gt; 0\)` and `\(E''(w) &lt; 0\)`

]

--



`$$\Pi = p \cdot f(N) - \frac{w}{e}N$$`


Minimize `\(\frac{w}{e} = \frac{w}{E(w)}\)`

--

`$$\frac{w}{dw} (\frac{w}{E(w)}) = \frac{E(w) - w E'(w)}{E(w)^2} = 0$$`
--


`$$\frac{de}{dw} = E'(w*) = \frac{E(w*)}{w*} = \frac{e}{w}$$`

---

When wages are set by the employer in this manner, they are sometimes called **efficiency wages:**
--
 wages set higher than the reservation wage so workers will care about losing the job and provide more effort. 
 
--

The labor discipline model explains that:

1)	**Equilibrium** – Employers offer wages, and employees respond with effort, forming a Nash equilibrium.
	
2)	**Rent** – Employees work diligently because they receive an employment rent, which they risk losing if they slack off.

3)	**Power** – The fear of losing this rent gives employers power over workers, compelling them to exert effort, which boosts employer profits.


--

### Implications: 

- In the labour discipline model, there is always **involuntary unemployment:**
--
 being out of work, but preferring to have a job at the wages and working conditions that otherwise identical employed workers have. 

--

- In equilibrium, both wages and involuntary unemployment have to be high enough to ensure employment rent is high enough for workers to put in effort.
  


---

# Putting the model to work: Owners, employees, and the economy

---
## Factors shifting the equilibrium

- **Employees' best response function will shift** in reaction to changes in:

--

  - the utility of the things that can be bought with the wage
  - the disutility of effort
  - the reservation wage
  - the probability of getting fired when working at each effort level
  - unemployment


---
### Factors shifting the equilibrium

&lt;img src="imgs/figure-06-07-a.svg" width="75%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

The position of the best response curve depends on the reservation wage. It crosses the horizontal axis at this point.

---
### Factors shifting the equilibrium

&lt;img src="imgs/figure-06-07-b.svg" width="75%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

A rise in the unemployment benefit increases the reservation wage and shifts the worker’s best response curve to the right.

---
### Factors shifting the equilibrium

&lt;img src="imgs/figure-06-07-c.svg" width="75%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

If unemployment rises, the expected duration of unemployment increases. So the worker’s reservation wage falls and the best response curve shifts to the left.

---
### Factors shifting the equilibrium

&lt;img src="imgs/figure-06-07-d.svg" width="75%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

For a given hourly wage, say $18, workers put in different levels of effort when the levels of unemployment or unemployment benefit change.

Agent takes action that is hidden from the principal, which is why the principal cannot verify it.

--

A hidden action problem occurs when

  - there is a conflict of interest between the principal and the agent 
  - over some action that may be taken by the agent
  - and this action cannot be subjected to a complete contract.

--

The information about the action may be either asymmetric or unverifiable.

## Summary


1. Firms: owners and managers have power over workers


  - Contracts are incomplete – do not cover worker effort
  

  - Employment rents motivate workers to exert effort
  

  - An example of a hidden action problem between a principal (firm) and an agent (worker)
  

2. Labour-discipline model of wage-setting within firms

  - Isocost curves = firm’s ‘indifference curves’
  
  - Best response curve = maximum feasible effort, given wages
  
  - Profit-maximising choice where MRS = MRT

  - Involuntary unemployment as a feature of the equilibrium

### 1. Employment rents

Choose the correct answer(s):

Maria earns $12 per hour in her current job and works 35 hours a week. Her disutility of effort is equivalent to a cost of $2 per hour of work. If she loses her job, she will receive unemployment benefit equivalent to $6 per hour. Additionally, being unemployed has psychological and social costs equivalent to $1 per hour. Then:


a) The employment rent per hour is $3.

b) Maria’s reservation wage is $6 per hour.

c) Maria’s employment rent if she can get another job with the same wage rate after 44 weeks of being unemployed is $6,160.

d) Maria’s employment rent if she can only get a job at a lower wage rate after 44 weeks of being unemployed is more than $7,700.

**d) Maria’s employment rent if she can only get a job at a lower wage rate after 44 weeks of being unemployed is more than $7,700.**
&lt;/span&gt;

 - If she could get a job at the same wage after 44 weeks, Maria’s employment rent = 5 (employment rent per hour) × 35 hours per week × 44 weeks = 7,700. If the new job were to have a lower wage, her employment rent in the current job would be higher than 7,700.

### 2. Employee's best response curve

Choose the correct answer(s):

.pull-left[
&lt;img src="imgs/figure-06-04-g.png" width="350%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
]

.pull-right[

a) If the expected unemployment duration increased to 50 weeks, Maria’s best response to a wage of $12 would be an effort level above 0.5.

b) If the unemployment benefit was reduced, then Maria’s reservation wage would be higher than $6.

c) Over the range of wages shown in the figure, Maria would never exert the maximum possible effort per hour.

d) Increasing effort from 0.5 to 0.6 requires a bigger wage increase than increasing effort from 0.8 to 0.9.

a) If the expected unemployment duration increased to 50 weeks, Maria’s best response to a wage of $12 would be an effort level above 0.5.
&lt;/span&gt;

 - 0.5 is Maria’s best response to a wage of $12 when expected unemployment duration is 44 weeks. If duration increases to 50 weeks, the cost of job loss is higher, so Maria will work harder for the same wage.

&lt;span style="color: #008ac4;"&gt;
c) Over the range of wages shown in the figure, Maria would never exert the maximum possible effort per hour.
&lt;/span&gt;

 - The best response curve is below the maximum possible level effort (1) at all wages shown.

### 3. Labour discipline model

Suppose that Maria’s reservation wage is `\(w_r\)` (a positive constant) and her best response function is:

$$ E(w) = k(w-w_r)^\alpha \quad (w &gt; w_r)$$
where the terms `\(k &gt; 0\)` and `\(0 &lt; \alpha &lt; 1\)` are constants.

Under the labour discipline model, what is the efficiency wage? What is the effort that Maria will put into work with such wage?

&lt;span style="color: #008ac4;"&gt;
From the class we now that the first-order condition to maximize profit from the employer is 
`$$E'(w^*) = E(w^*)/w^*$$`
&lt;/span&gt;

--

&lt;span style="color: #008ac4;"&gt;
`$$\Rightarrow E'(w^*) = k\alpha(w^*-w_r)^{\alpha-1}$$`
&lt;/span&gt;

--

&lt;span style="color: #008ac4;"&gt;
`$$\Rightarrow k\alpha(w^*-w_r)^{\alpha-1} = k(w^*-w_r)^{\alpha} / w^*$$`
&lt;/span&gt;

--

&lt;span style="color: #008ac4;"&gt;
`$$\iff \alpha(w^*-w_r)^{-1} =  1 / w^* \iff \alpha =  (w^*-w_r) / w^* \iff \alpha =  1 - w_r/ w^*$$`
&lt;/span&gt;

--

&lt;span style="color: #008ac4;"&gt;
`$$\iff w_r/ w^*  =  1 - \alpha \iff w^* / w_r = \frac{1}{1 - \alpha} \iff w^* = \frac{w_r}{1 - \alpha}$$`
&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span style="color: #008ac4;"&gt;
Thus, efficiency wage is:
`$$w^* = \frac{w_r}{1 - \alpha}$$`
&lt;/span&gt;

--

&lt;span style="color: #008ac4;"&gt;
Maria's effort will be:
$$\Rightarrow E(w^*) = k ( \frac{w_r}{1 - \alpha}  - w_r)^\alpha = k ( \frac{w_r - w_r + \alpha w_r}{1 - \alpha})^\alpha = k ( \frac{\alpha w_r}{1 - \alpha})^\alpha $$
