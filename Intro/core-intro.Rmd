# (After one semester) What is economics?
]

---
## Economics: 
--
The dismal science

--

Misunderstandings and (really) bad communication:
--

> *"Neoclassical economics has become an unquestioned belief system and treats anybody who challenges the creed of self-righting markets and rational consumers as dangerous heretics"* 

--

> *"Complex mathematics is used to mystify economics, just as congregations in Luther’s time were deliberately left in the dark by services conducted in Latin."*
    
--

> **Responsible of 2008 Great Recession**.

## Defending the dismal science 

--
OK. Economist can be quite arrogant (sometimes we are nice).
--
 But...

--

.pull-left[

> *"The economy did not die, and a Great Depression was avoided, in no small part due to the advances of economics over many decades"* (Ricardo Reis)


> *"The London Tube map is not realistic and makes absurd assumptions. [...] is useful precisely because it abstracts from unnecessary details to show you the way. This is what economic models are for, they help us to find our way through complex data in a complex world."* (Oriana Bandiera et al)

## Defending the dismal science 

--

> *"Economics' recent empirical bent makes it more difficult to idolize markets because it makes it more difficult to ignore inconvenient facts."* (Dani Rodrik, Suresh Naidu  and Gabriel Zucman)

## Again: What is Economics?
]

- **How we come to acquire the things that make up our livelihood**: Things like food, clothing, shelter, or free time.

- **How we interact with each other**: Either as buyers and sellers, employees or employers, citizens and public officials, parents, children and other family members.

- **How we interact with our natural environment**: From breathing, to extracting raw materials from the earth.

- **How each of these changes over time.**

.center[
## What is (Macro)Economics?
]

.center2[

#### Economics:

> *The study of how people interact with each other and with their natural surroundings in producing their livelihoods, and how this changes over time*

#### Macroeconomics:

> *concerned with the aggregate sum of spending decisions of [...] groups, and the consequences of those decisions for economy—wide outcomes such as the rate of unemployment or inflation* 
(Carlin and Soskice)

## (Philosophical note)
]

  - Everyone has their political or economic ideals!
    - Even economist. We are humans and social beings.
    - We can agree on a benchmark or minumum of acceptable ideas (i.e. as long as they respect human rights)

.center[
### What is $\neq$ What is ought to be
*John Neville Keynes*
]

.center[
### La historia, como la lucha entre el bien y el mal en la que, por definición, los buenos somos nosotros
*Mauricio Tenorio Trillo*
]

  - Difficult to argue on *scientific neutrality*. 
  We should advance towards accepting both the rigorous evidence that we like and dislike.

## This class
]

--

  - What we are going to do in this (and the following) classes?
  
--

  - Study concepts and models used to understand aggregate behavior in the short, medium, and long-run.

--
    - Gonna use a lot of things from Micro (including a couple of chapters)

--

  - Ideally: See how economics is useful to provide answers to real world situations (big picture).

--

  - **Spoiler**: We will only have a better understanding. Unfortunately, we would not be able to fully know what happen, is happening, or will happen. But that's because there is uncertainty and we are humans

**50% Exam **: 03/06/2025

In teams of 5, students will choose one of the six Capstone chapters of The Economy (chapters 17-22). The team has to do and deliver the following:

--

**- 25% Presentation**: In-depth reading of the chapter, summarize it and present it to the rest of the class.

--

**- 25% Policy brief**: Write a policy brief related to the chapter. 

--

  - A motivation based on contemporary, relevant issues to solve locally, in another location,
or globally.
  - A detailed and delimited policy question.
  - A brief literature review on the topic.
  - The use of data to describe the problem and context.
  - A policy proposal to tackle the problem.
  - A research question proposal to further study in more depth the topic (only the research question).


Teams will have to schedule a meeting in office hours to discuss their policy brief proposals with me.

- Respect your classmates and instructor. Harassment of any kind will not be tolerated.
- **No electronic devices (computers, cellphones, tablets) are allowed during lectures.** Want evidence? [Read this](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/22/business/laptops-not-during-lecture-or-meeting.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fbusiness&action=click&contentCollection=business&region=rank&module=package&version=highlights&contentPlacement=12&pgtype=sectionfront).
- Academic integrity is mandatory. Cite all sources properly. **Cheating during exams or using ChatGPT as a substitute rather than a complement will result in strict penalties.**
- If the classroom environment becomes disruptive (e.g., excessive noise), the class will be terminated, and the subject will be considered complete.
