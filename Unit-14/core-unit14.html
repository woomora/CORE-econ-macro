Aggregate demand (GDP) can fluctuate due to consumption and investment decisions.

--

Sometimes the aggregate decisions of households and firms can destabilize the economy.

--

- How can the government stabilize the economy?

--

- Why might government policies be ineffective? 

--

- How can we model the link between output and unemployment?

--

Use a model of aggregate demand to explain how government spending can stabilize the economy

.center[
## Consumption function
]

Marginal propensity to consume varies across people:

--

- poor households with credit constraints react a lot to variation in current income, so their MPC is large

--

- for wealthy households, current income matters little for current consumption, so their MPC is small

--

Expectations about future income are reflected in autonomous consumption.

## Goods market equilibrium
]

`$$output= \textit{aggregate demand for goods produced in the home economy}$$`
`$$Y = AD$$`

--

&lt;img src="imgs/f14-4-a.png" width="55%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

**Goods market equilibrium**: the economy will continue producing at that output level unless something changes spending behaviour.

---
.center[
## Goods market equilibrium
]

`$$Y = AD$$`

&lt;img src="imgs/f14-4-b.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

The 45-degree line from the origin of the diagram shows all the combinations in which output is equal to aggregate demand, meaning the economy is in goods market equilibrium.

---
.center[
## Goods market equilibrium
]
`$$Y = AD = c_0 + c_1 Y$$`
&lt;img src="imgs/f14-4-c.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

The first component of aggregate demand is consumption, which is represented by the consumption line.

---
.center[
## Goods market equilibrium
]

`$$Y = AD = c_0 + c_1 Y + I$$`

&lt;img src="imgs/f14-4-d.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

Adding investment to the consumption line simply leads to a parallel upward shift of the aggregate demand line.

---
.center[
## The multiplier process
]

Changes in output can be greater than the initial change in aggregate demand. 

--

This is because of the circular flow of expenditure, income, and output.

--

`$$Y = AD = C + I = c_0 + c_1 Y + I$$`

--

`$$\Rightarrow Y - c_1 Y = c_0 + I \iff Y \cdot (1 - c_1) = c_0 + I$$`
`$$\iff Y  = \frac{1}{(1 - c_1)} \cdot (c_0 + I)$$`
--

The multiplier represents the relative magnitude of this change.

--

- multiplier = 1: the increase in GDP = the initial increase in spending

--

- multiplier &gt; (&lt;) 1: the total increase in GDP &gt; (&lt;) the initial increase in spending

--

**Decrease on investment**
--
 `\(\rightarrow\)` lower spending
--
 `\(\rightarrow\)` lower production and lower incomes
--
 `\(\rightarrow\)`
firms will fire workers
--
 `\(\rightarrow\)` further decline in spending

**Precautionary saving**: An increase in saving to restore wealth to its target level. 

&lt;img src="imgs/f14-8-c.png" width="50%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

- A fall in expected earnings will lead to cut in consumption (precautionary savings) to restore target wealth.

- Changes in house prices affect consumption through 1) changes in household wealth (home equity), and 2) changes in credit constraints -lower house value makes it more difficult to borrow (greater credit constraint)-.

Volatility of investment vs the smoothness of consumption spending.
--
 How do firms make investment decisions? What to do with accumulated profits?
 
--

- *Dividends*: Allocate the funds to managerial or employee salaries, or to dividends for owners.
- *Saving*: Buy an interest-bearing financial asset such as a bond, or retire (pay off) existing debt.
- *Investment abroad*: Build new productive capacity in another country.
- **Investment at home**: Build new capacity in the home country.

`$$\rho$$`

- Interest rate on assets: 
`$$r$$`

- Net profit rate on investment:
`$$\Pi$$`

- Consume the extra income (dividends) if 

`$$\rho &gt; r ≥ \Pi$$`

- Save the extra income/repay debts if

`$$r &gt; \rho ≥ \Pi$$`

- Invest (at home or abroad) if Π &gt; ρ ≥ r 

`$$\Pi &gt; \rho ≥ r$$`

**A lower interest rate makes investment more likely.**

Improvement in business environment (such as fall in the risk of expropriation by the government) also increases investment.

How investment spending in the economy as a whole depends on other variables (interest rate and profit expectations). 

Investment is not very sensitive to interest rate. Instead, the shift factors are much more important.

.center[
## The multiplier model (again)

`$$AD = Y = c_0 + c_1(1 - t) Y + I(r) + G + X - mY$$`

--

Saving, taxation and imports are referred to as leakages from the circular flow of income.
--
 They reduce the size of the multiplier.
 
--

- some household income goes directly to the government as taxes
- some income is used to buy goods abroad

--

$$ Y = \frac{1}{1 - c_1 (1 - t) + m} \cdot (c_0 + I(r) + G + M)$$
--

Smaller multiplier = flatter AD curve. 

---
.center[
## Stabilising the economy
]

There are three main ways that government spending and taxation can dampen fluctuations in the economy:

--

- The size of government: government spending on consumption and investment is usually stable.
  - Higher tax rate lowers the multiplier
- Automatic stabilization mechanisms: Unemployment insurance helps households smooth consumption
  - Failure of private market because of correlated risk, hidden actions, hidden attributes
- **Fiscal policy**

--

.pull-left[

**The paradox of thrift**: the aggregate attempt to increase savings leads to a fall in aggregate income.

- A family worried about their falling wealth cuts spending and saves more

- But in the economy as a whole, spending and earning go together

**Fallacy of composition:** what is true for one part of the economy (a single household) is not true of the whole economy.

## Summary
]

- The aggregate demand function and its components: `\(AD = C + I + G + NX\)`

- Shocks to aggregate demand are amplified by the multiplier

- Government can stabilise economic fluctuations
  - Automatic stabilisers
  - Fiscal stimulus – offset decline in aggregate demand from the private sector
  - Austerity policies amplify the negative demand shock

- Fiscal stimulus in a recession must be reversed in a boom to prevent government debt from escalating (sovereign debt crisis)

--
## Next session

- The relationship between unemployment and inflation: The Phillips curve

- How governments use monetary policy to affect inflation

- Developing our model of aggregate demand: What happens to wages and prices in booms/recessions
