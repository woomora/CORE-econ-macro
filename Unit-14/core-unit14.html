## This Unit

Aggregate demand (GDP) can fluctuate due to consumption and investment decisions.

--

Sometimes the aggregate decisions of households and firms can destabilize the economy.

--

- How can the government stabilize the economy?

--

- Why might government policies be ineffective? 

--

- How can we model the link between output and unemployment?

--

Use a model of aggregate demand to explain how government spending can stabilize the economy

 and investment.

`$$C = c_0 + c_1 Y$$`

- `\(c_1 \rightarrow\)` **marginal propensity to consume (MPC)**: the effect of one additional unit of income on consumption.

## Consumption function

&lt;img src="imgs/f14-2-c.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
## Consumption function

Marginal propensity to consume varies across people:

--

- poor households with credit constraints react a lot to variation in current income, so their MPC is large

--

- for wealthy households, current income matters little for current consumption, so their MPC is small

--

Expectations about future income are reflected in autonomous consumption.

## Goods market equilibrium: The multiplier diagram

`$$output= \textit{aggregate demand for goods produced in the home economy}$$`
`$$Y = AD$$`

--

&lt;img src="imgs/f14-4-a.png" width="55%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

**Goods market equilibrium**: the economy will continue producing at that output level unless something changes spending behaviour.

---
## Goods market equilibrium: The multiplier diagram

`$$Y = AD$$`

&lt;img src="imgs/f14-4-b.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

The 45-degree line from the origin of the diagram shows all the combinations in which output is equal to aggregate demand, meaning the economy is in goods market equilibrium.

---
## Goods market equilibrium: The multiplier diagram

`$$Y = AD = c_0 + c_1 Y$$`
&lt;img src="imgs/f14-4-c.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

The first component of aggregate demand is consumption, which is represented by the consumption line.

---
## Goods market equilibrium: The multiplier diagram

`$$Y = AD = c_0 + c_1 Y + I$$`

&lt;img src="imgs/f14-4-d.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

Adding investment to the consumption line simply leads to a parallel upward shift of the aggregate demand line.

---
### The multiplier process

Changes in output can be greater than the initial change in aggregate demand. 

--

This is because of the circular flow of expenditure, income, and output.

--

`$$Y = AD = C + I = c_0 + c_1 Y + I$$`

--

`$$\Rightarrow Y - c_1 Y = c_0 + I \iff Y \cdot (1 - c_1) = c_0 + I$$`
`$$\iff Y  = \frac{1}{(1 - c_1)} \cdot (c_0 + I)$$`
--

The multiplier represents the relative magnitude of this change.

--

- multiplier = 1: the increase in GDP = the initial increase in spending

--

- multiplier &gt; (&lt;) 1: the total increase in GDP &gt; (&lt;) the initial increase in spending

--

**Decrease on investment**
--
 `\(\rightarrow\)` lower spending
--
 `\(\rightarrow\)` lower production and lower incomes
--
 `\(\rightarrow\)`
firms will fire workers
--
 `\(\rightarrow\)` further decline in spending

---
### The multiplier process

&lt;img src="imgs/f14-5-a.png" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

The economy starts at point A, in goods market equilibrium.

---
### The multiplier process

&lt;img src="imgs/f14-5-b.png" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

The fall in investment cuts aggregate demand by EUR 1.5 billion, and the economy moves vertically downward from point A to point B.

---
### The multiplier process

&lt;img src="imgs/f14-5-c.png" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

With demand lower, firms cut back production and reduce employment. With output and employment lower, incomes fall by €1.5 billion. This is the move from B to C.

---
### The multiplier process

&lt;img src="imgs/f14-5-d.png" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

When household incomes fall, consumption drops—often due to credit constraints. Initially, aggregate consumption falls by 0.6 times the income loss (from point C to point D).

---
### The multiplier process

&lt;img src="imgs/f14-5-e.png" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

Firms respond by cutting production, output falls, and the economy moves from point D to point E.

---
### The multiplier process

&lt;img src="imgs/f14-5-f.png" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

The process will go on until the economy reaches point Z.

---
### The multiplier process

&lt;img src="imgs/f14-5-g.png" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

This goes through point Z and shows the new goods market equilibrium of the economy following the investment shock.

---
### The multiplier process

&lt;img src="imgs/f14-5-h.png" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

The total fall in output exceeds the initial size of the decline in investment; output has fallen by €3.75 billion.

---
### The multiplier process

&lt;img src="imgs/f14-5-i.png" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

The total change in output is 2.5 times larger than the initial change in investment.


---
### The multiplier process: Quizz

.pull-left[
The following diagram depicts the change in the aggregate goods market equilibrium when there is a EUR 2 billion increase in investment.

The economy’s marginal propensity to consume is 0.5. Based on this information, which of the following statements is correct?

a) The new goods market equilibrium after the investment increase is E.

b) Aggregate demand increases by a total of €2 billion × 0.5 = €1 billion due to the increase in investment.

c) The multiplier is 2.

d) The distance between C and D is three-quarters the distance between A and B (€1.5 billion).

### The multiplier process: Quizz

❌ a) The new goods market equilibrium after the investment increase is E. 

 - The equilibrium is where the aggregate consumption line intersects with the 45-degree line. Therefore the new equilibrium is Z.

❌ a) Aggregate demand increases by a total of €2 billion × 0.5 = €1 billion due to the increase in investment.

 - The diagram shows that the increase in investment results in a €4 billion increase in aggregate demand.

&lt;span style="color: #008ac4;"&gt;
✅ **c) The multiplier is 2. **
&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span style="color: #008ac4;"&gt;
**The multiplier is equal to 1/(1 − 0.5) = 2.**
&lt;/span&gt;


❌ a) The distance between C and D is three-quarters the distance between A and B (€1.5 billion).

 - The distance between A and B is the initial increase in investment of €2 billion. At C, the output Y has increased by €2 billion compared with B, which results in an increase in the aggregate demand of ΔY (change in Y) × MPC, that is, €2 billion × 0.5 = €1 billion.

- A fall in expected earnings will lead to cut in consumption (precautionary savings) to restore target wealth.

- Changes in house prices affect consumption through 1) changes in household wealth (home equity), and 2) changes in credit constraints -lower house value makes it more difficult to borrow (greater credit constraint)-.

Volatility of investment vs the smoothness of consumption spending.

 How do firms make investment decisions? What to do with accumulated profits?
 
--

- *Dividends*: Allocate the funds to managerial or employee salaries, or to dividends for owners.
- *Saving*: Buy an interest-bearing financial asset such as a bond, or retire (pay off) existing debt.
- *Investment abroad*: Build new productive capacity in another country.
- **Investment at home**: Build new capacity in the home country.

**A lower interest rate makes investment more likely.**

&lt;img src="imgs/f14-9-a.png" width="52%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

&lt;img src="imgs/f14-9-c.png" width="52%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

If the interest rate remains at 5%, Firm A goes ahead with project 1 and Firm B does not invest at all. But if the interest rate was 2%, A would undertake projects 1 and 2 and B would undertake all three of its projects.

The lower panel aggregates the potential investments of the two firms, arranged by the expected profit rate as before.

&lt;img src="imgs/f14-9-e.png" width="52%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

Investment in the economy increases after a fall in the interest rate. Five projects go ahead, instead of just one.

---

Higher expected rate of profit `\(E(\Pi)\)` increases investment, holding `\(r\)` constant.

&lt;img src="imgs/f14-10a-a.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

With the interest rate equal to 5%, only one project will go ahead.

Higher expected rate of profit `\(E(\Pi)\)` increases investment, holding `\(r\)` constant.

&lt;img src="imgs/f14-10a-b.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

Improvement in business environment (such as fall in the risk of expropriation by the government) also increases investment.

---

Higher expected rate of profit `\(E(\Pi)\)` increases investment, holding `\(r\)` constant.

&lt;img src="imgs/f14-10a-b.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

For the same interest rate, investment rises: two more projects go ahead.

---

Higher forecast demand raises the desired size of each project, so investment rises.

&lt;img src="imgs/f14-10b-a.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

With the interest rate equal to 2%, and the initial desired capacity, investment is shown by the darker coloured blocks.

Higher forecast demand raises the desired size of each project, so investment rises.

&lt;img src="imgs/f14-10b-b.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

Pressure on existing capacity from higher forecast demand raises the desired size of each project, so investment rises to include the lighter coloured blocks.

## Aggregate investment function

&lt;img src="imgs/f14-10c-a.png" width="55%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

In an economy with many thousands of firms, all their potential investment projects are represented by a downward-sloping aggregate investment function.

---
## Aggregate investment function

In response to a fall in the interest rate, investment increases from C to E.

## Aggregate investment function

&lt;img src="imgs/f14-10c-c.png" width="55%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

How investment spending in the economy as a whole depends on other variables (interest rate and profit expectations). 

Investment is not very sensitive to interest rate. Instead, the shift factors are much more important.

## Aggregate investment function: Quizz

❌ a) Ceteris paribus, an increase in the interest rate would lead to a fall in investment due to an inward shift of the investment line.

 - The investment line represents the relationship between investment and interest rate, ceteris paribus. Therefore the fall in investment would be shown by a movement up the original line (from E to C for example), not a shift of the line.

❌ b) A rise in corporate tax would shift the investment line outwards.

 - A rise in corporate tax would decrease the expected profit rate, shifting the investment line inwards. This results in a fall in investment.

&lt;span style="color: #008ac4;"&gt;
✅ **c) A forecast of a permanent demand increase shifts the investment line outwards.**
&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span style="color: #008ac4;"&gt;
Higher demand makes it profitable to invest in larger projects, increasing investment at a given interest rate.
&lt;/span&gt;

❌ b) A steeper line indicates the higher sensitivity of the level of aggregate investment to changes in interest rate.
 
 - A steeper line means smaller changes in investment when the interest rate moves, that is, lower sensitivity of investment to the interest rate.

- The size of government: government spending on consumption and investment is usually stable.
  - Higher tax rate lowers the multiplier
- Automatic stabilization mechanisms: Unemployment insurance helps households smooth consumption
  - Failure of private market because of correlated risk, hidden actions, hidden attributes
- **Fiscal policy**

--

**The paradox of thrift**: the aggregate attempt to increase savings leads to a fall in aggregate income.

- A family worried about their falling wealth cuts spending and saves more

- But in the economy as a whole, spending and earning go together

**Fallacy of composition:** what is true for one part of the economy (a single household) is not true of the whole economy.

The economy moves into recession. This occurs after a fall in consumer confidence, reducing `\(c_0\)`. The aggregate demand line shifts downward and the economy moves from point A to point B.

The government then increases spending, from G to G′, in order to counteract the decline in aggregate demand. AD shifts back up and the economy moves to point C.

The rise in G operates via the multiplier, so the increase in Y will typically be greater than the increase in G.

- When government chooses to reduce its deficit, this may amplify fluctuations in the economy.

Suppose that the government then reduces spending from G to G′, in a bid to offset the deterioration of its budget balance. The recession then feeds back to raise government transfers and reduce tax revenue.

## How responsive is the economy to government spending?
]

- In reality, the multiplier also depends on:

  -  rate of capacity utilisation (the phase of the business cycle):  with fully employed resources, an increase in government spending would **crowd out** private spending

  - expectations of the private sector: the multiplier could be negative if rising fiscal deficit erodes consumer confidence

- A large stock of debt relative to GDP can be a problem because the government has to pay interest on its debt.

- There is no point at which the government has to pay off all its stock of debt—it can roll it over instead by issuing new bonds.

- Indebtedness can fall
  - if the primary budget balance is positive
  - if GDP is growing faster than government debt
  - if inflation is high (real value of debt falls)

## Foreign markets and aggregate demand

- Fluctuations in the growth rate of important markets abroad influence the domestic economy via demand for exports.

- Demand for imports dampens domestic fluctuations (marginal propoensity to import).

- Foreign trade limits the use of fiscal stimulus if the marginal propensity to import is large.

## Foreign markets and aggregate demand: France and Germany

A striking example comes from France in the 1980s. 

At the start of the 1980s, the French economy remained weak following the oil shocks of the 1970s, which disrupted the world economy. 

In 1981, François Mitterrand won the presidential election. 

His appointed prime minister, Pierre Mauroy, implemented a program to stimulate aggregate demand through increased government spending and tax cuts (in the multiplier model, this is a rise in G and a fall in t, the tax rate).

## Foreign markets and aggregate demand: France and Germany

&lt;img src="imgs/f14-16.png" width="75%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

The figure presents the outcomes for three years. In the first year, there was no stimulus, in the second, there was a fiscal stimulus in France, and the third year was the year following the stimulus.

## Foreign markets and aggregate demand: France and Germany

&lt;img src="imgs/f14-16.png" width="75%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

France’s budget balance turned negative after 1980, with a deficit exceeding 3% of GDP by 1983, while Germany maintained a balanced budget.

France’s expansionary fiscal policy in 1982 led to a brief increase in growth, but most of the demand boosted imports, benefiting countries like Germany and Japan instead.

&lt;img src="imgs/f14-16.png" width="75%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

The French stimulus failed to significantly improve domestic output or employment and caused pressure on the French franc, requiring three devaluations by 1983.

## Summary
]

- The aggregate demand function and its components: `\(AD = C + I + G + NX\)`

- Shocks to aggregate demand are amplified by the multiplier

- Government can stabilise economic fluctuations
  - Automatic stabilisers
  - Fiscal stimulus – offset decline in aggregate demand from the private sector
  - Austerity policies amplify the negative demand shock

- Fiscal stimulus in a recession must be reversed in a boom to prevent government debt from escalating (sovereign debt crisis)
