---
## Production: Economies of Scale

- A firm’s costs depend on its scale of production and the type of production technology it has.

--

- Large firms can be more profitable than small firms because of technological and/or cost advantages.

--

Production function (technology): $Y = f(X) = X^{\alpha}$.
--
 Inputs increase in a given proportion: $\lambda > 0$

--

$$ \Rightarrow f(\lambda X) = (\lambda X)^{\alpha} = \lambda^{\alpha} X^{\alpha} = \lambda^{\alpha} f(X) $$

--

| Production | Technology | Homogeneity |
| -----------------------------------------|
| Increases more than proportionally | **Increasing returns to scale** | $f(\lambda X) > \lambda f(X) \quad \forall \alpha > 1$ |
| Increases proportionally | **Constant returns to scale** | $f(\lambda X) = \lambda f(X) \quad \alpha = 1$ |
| Increases less than proportionally | **Decreasing returns to scale** | $f(\lambda X) < \lambda f(X) \quad \forall \alpha < 1$ |

--

- Cost advantages – Large firms can purchase inputs on more favourable terms.

- Demand advantages - Network effects (value of output rises with number of users e.g. software application)

- Large firms can also suffer from diseconomies of scale, e.g. additional layers of bureaucracy due to too many employees.

# Production: Cost functions
]

---
##  Cost functions

To make pricing and production decisions, managers need to know the costs of production.

--

How total production costs vary with quantity produced. 

--

- **Total cost**: Total cost for each level of output.

--

- **Average cost**: Average cost per unit produced.

--

- **Marginal cost**: the effect on total cost of producing one additional unit of output.

---

```

---
### Average and Marginal cost

```{r out.width="75%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/figure-07-08-b.svg")
```

When Q = 20, the average cost is 4,000, but the marginal cost is only 2,200. So if 21 cars rather than 20 are produced, that will reduce the average cost. Average cost is lower at Q = 21.

---
### Average and Marginal cost

```{r out.width="75%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/figure-07-08-c.svg")
```

At any point, like point A, where AC > MC, the average cost will fall if one more car is produced, so the AC curve slopes downward.

---
### Average and Marginal cost

```{r out.width="75%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/figure-07-08-d.svg")
```

At point D where Q = 60, the average cost is 3,600, but the cost of producing the 61st car is 4,600. So the average cost of a car will rise if 61 cars are produced. When AC < MC, the average cost curve slopes upward.

---
### Average and Marginal cost

```{r out.width="75%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/figure-07-08-e.svg")
```

At point B, where the average cost is lowest, the average and marginal costs are equal. The two curves cross. When AC = MC, the AC curve doesn’t slope up or down: it is flat (the slope is zero).

# Demand and isoprofit curves
]

---
## Demand curve

Quantity that consumers will buy at each price. 

--

```{r out.width="75%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/figure-07-09.svg")
```

---
## Isoprofit curve

$$\textit{profit} = \textit{total revenue} -  \textit{total cost} = PQ - C(Q)$$

--


$$\textit{profit} = Q\cdot (P - \frac{C(Q)}{Q})$$
--


$$\textit{profit} = Q\cdot (P - AC)$$

--

 - Price-quantity combinations that give the same profit. 

--

- Shape of the isoprofit curves will depend on the shape of the average cost curve.

---
### Isoprofit curve

```{r out.width="80%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/figure-07-10-a.svg")
```

The lightest blue curve is the firm’s average cost curve. If P = AC, the firm’s economic profit is zero. So the AC curve is also the zero-profit curve: it shows all the combinations of P and Q that give zero economic profit.

---
### Isoprofit curve

```{r out.width="80%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/figure-07-10-b.svg")
```

Beautiful Cars has decreasing AC when Q < 40, and increasing AC when Q > 40. When Q is low, it needs a high price to break even. If Q = 40 it could break even with a price of $3,400. For Q > 40, it would need to raise the price again to avoid a loss.

---
### Isoprofit curve

```{r out.width="80%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/figure-07-10-c.svg")
```

Beautiful Cars has increasing marginal costs: the upward-sloping line. Remember that the AC curve slopes down if AC > MC, and up if AC < MC. The two curves cross at B, where AC is lowest.

---
### Isoprofit curve

```{r out.width="80%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/figure-07-10-d.svg")
```

The darker blue curves show the combinations of P and Q giving higher levels of profit, so points G and K give the same profit.

---
### Isoprofit curve

```{r out.width="80%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/figure-07-10-e.svg")
```

At G where the firm makes 23 cars, the price is 6,820 and the average cost is 3,777. The firm makes a profit of 3,043 on each car, and its total profit is 70,000.

---
### Isoprofit curve

```{r out.width="80%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/figure-07-10-f.svg")
```

Profit is higher on the curves closer to the top-right corner in the diagram. Point H has the same quantity as K, so the average cost is the same, but the price is higher at H.

--

$$\Rightarrow \max_{Q} \Pi = f (Q) \cdot Q - C(Q)  $$
--

$$\Rightarrow \frac{d\Pi}{dQ} = f '(Q) \cdot Q + f (Q) - C'(Q) = 0 $$

--

$$\Rightarrow f '(Q) = \frac{C'(Q) - f (Q)}{Q}$$
--

$$\Rightarrow MRT = MRS$$

# The elasticity of demand
]

## Price Elasticity of Demand

Maximize profit by choosing the point where the slope of the isoprofit curve (MRS) is equal to the slope of the demand curve (MRT),
--
 which represents the trade-off that the firm is constrained to make between price and quantity.
 
--

So the firm’s decision depends on how steep the demand curve is:
--
 in other words, how much consumers’ demand for a good will change if the price changes.
 
--

$$\varepsilon = - \frac{\% \textit{change in demand}}{\%  \textit{change in price}} = - \frac{100 (\frac{\Delta Q}{Q})}{100 (\frac{\Delta P}{P})}$$

--

Which functional form for the demand function allow us to estimate price elasticity? 
--
 Logaritmic function.
 
--

$$ln(Q) = ln(P) \Rightarrow \frac{d ln (Q)}{d Q} = \frac{d ln (P)}{d P} \iff \frac{ \frac{1}{Q}}{d Q} = \frac{\frac{1}{P}}{d P} \iff \frac{d Q}{Q} = \frac{d P}{P}$$

---

```{r out.width="45%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/figure-07-15-a.svg")
```


Price elasticity changes throughout the demand curve.


$$\varepsilon = - \frac{100 (\frac{\Delta Q}{Q})}{100 (\frac{\Delta P}{P})}$$

A firm’s **markup** (profit margin as a proportion of the price) is *inversely proportional* to price elasticity of demand.


$$\varepsilon = - \frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta P} \cdot \frac{P}{Q}$$

--

$$ \frac{\Delta P}{\Delta Q} = - \frac{1}{\varepsilon } \cdot \frac{P}{Q}$$

--

In optimiality, a firm must choose $MRT = MRS$, thus the slope of the demand should be equal to the slope of the isoprofit curve: $\frac{C'(Q) - f(Q)}{Q} = \frac{MC - P}{Q}$

--

$$\Rightarrow  - \frac{1}{\varepsilon } \cdot \frac{P}{Q} = \frac{MC - P}{Q}$$

--

$$\iff  - \frac{1}{\varepsilon } = \frac{MC - P}{P}$$
where $\frac{MC - P}{P}$ is the markup.

 - The profit level for the isoprofit curve going through C can be calculated at Q = 10, where AC = 20, and P = 70. So the profit is (70 − 20) × 10 = 500. At C, Q = 20, so profit per unit is (P − AC) = 25. Since AC is 25, P must be 50.

d) The price at B is 36.

--

```{r echo = T}
data <-  
  data %>% 
  mutate(
    # Average cost function
    ac = 50/q + (.5*q),
    # Marginal cost function
    mc = q,
    # (Inverse) Demand function
    p = 120 - q
  )

head(data)
```

---

Let's plot the demand curve:

--

```{r echo = T, out.width="65%"}
data %>% pivot_longer(!q) %>% 
  # We only wanna see the demand curve
  filter(name == "p") %>% 
  # We use ggplot canvas
  ggplot(aes(q, value, color = name)) + geom_line() + geom_point(size = .1) + labs(x = "Q", y = "P", color = "Curve")
```

---

Let's plot the average cost curve:

--

```{r echo = T, out.width="65%"}
data %>% pivot_longer(!q) %>% 
  # We only wanna see the AC curve
  filter(name == "ac") %>% 
  # We use ggplot canvas
  ggplot(aes(q, value, color = name)) + geom_line() + geom_point(size = .1) + labs(x = "Q", y = "P", color = "Curve")
```

---

Let's plot the average cost curve more closely:

```{r echo = T, out.width="65%"}
data %>% pivot_longer(!q) %>% 
  # We only wanna see the AC curve
  filter(name == "ac") %>% 
  # We only focus in Q values around AC shifts its slope
  filter(q %in% seq(5,20)) %>% 
  # We use ggplot canvas
  ggplot(aes(q, value, color = name)) + geom_line() + geom_point(size = .1) + labs(x = "Q", y = "P", color = "Curve") 
```

---

Let's plot the average cost and marginal cost curve:

--

```{r echo = T, out.width="65%"}
data %>% pivot_longer(!q) %>% 
  # We only wanna see the AC and MC curve
  filter(name != "p") %>% 
  # We use ggplot canvas
  ggplot(aes(q, value, color = name)) + geom_line() + geom_point(size = .1) + labs(x = "Q", y = "P", color = "Curve") 
```

---

Let's plot the average cost and marginal cost curve more closely:


```{r echo = T, out.width="65%"}
data %>% pivot_longer(!q) %>% 
  # We only wanna see the AC and MC curve
  filter(name != "p") %>% 
    # We only focus in Q values around AC shifts its slope
  filter(q %in% seq(5,20)) %>% 
  # We use ggplot canvas
  ggplot(aes(q, value, color = name)) + geom_line() + geom_point(size = .1) + labs(x = "Q", y = "P", color = "Curve") + coord_cartesian(ylim = c(8,12)) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 10, linetype = "dashed") + geom_hline(yintercept = 10, linetype = "dashed") 
```

---

Let's compute the revenue and marginal revenue:

```{r echo = T}
data <-  
  data %>% 
  mutate(
    # Revenue or profit
    revenue = p * q,
    # Marginal revenue Δ R / Δ Q
    mr = (revenue - dplyr::lag(revenue))/(1)
  ) 

data
```

---

Let's plot everything together (but the total revenue)

```{r echo = T, out.width="65%", warning=FALSE}
data %>% select(-revenue) %>% pivot_longer(!q) %>% 
  # We use ggplot canvas
  ggplot(aes(q, value, color = name)) + geom_line() + geom_point(size = .1) + labs(x = "Q", y = "P", color = "Curve") + coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0,120))
```

---

Let's plot everything together (but the total revenue)

```{r echo = F, out.width="100%", warning=FALSE}
data %>% select(-revenue) %>% pivot_longer(!q) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(q, value, color = name)) + geom_line() + geom_point(size = .1) + labs(x = "Q", y = "P", color = "Curve") + 
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0,120)) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = 40, y = 40), color = "black", size = 2) + 
  annotate("text", label = "MR = MC", x = 47.5, y = 40, size = 3)
```

  annotate("text", label = "MR = MC", x = 47.5, y = 40, size = 3) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 40, linetype = "dashed")

  geom_point(aes(x = 40, y = 80), color = "black", size = 2) + 
  annotate("text", label = "P(Q*) = 80", x = 47.5, y = 84, size = 3) 
```
