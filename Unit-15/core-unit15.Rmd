## Context

Governments can use fiscal policy e.g. spending, taxation to stabilize the economy during recessions. (Unit 14)

--

Besides unemployment, fluctuations in GDP also affect prices.

--

- What factors affect the price level in an economy?

- What is the ideal level of inflation and how do central banks achieve it?

- How do central banks respond differently to supply-side and demand-side shocks?

--
## This Unit

- **Inflation**: causes and effects on the economy

- The trade-off between inflation and unemployment

- How central banks can use monetary policy to respond to shocks in the economy

- The importance of expectations and how central banks can manage them

# Inflation
]


---
## Inflation

- **Inflation**: an increase in the general price level

--

  - **Zero inflation**: A constant price level from year to year
  - **Deflation**: A decrease in the general price level
  - **Disinflation**: A decrease in the rate of inflation


```{r out.width = "30%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://media.giphy.com/media/xT5LMW0JYGEd9EIQF2/giphy.gif")
```

--

Fisher's equation:

$$ \textit{Real interest rate} = \textit{Nominal interest rate} – \textit{Inflation rate}$$

$$ r = i – \pi$$


---
## Measuring inflation

--

.pull-left[

**Consumer Price Index (CPI)**

Measures the general level of prices that consumers have to pay for goods and services, including consumption taxes

- Based on a representative bundle of consumer goods – “cost of living”
- Common measure of inflation = change in CPI 

]

.pull-left[

**GDP deflator**

A measure of the level of prices for domestically produced output (ratio of nominal to real GDP) 

- Tracks prices of components of GDP (C, I, G, NX)
- Allows GDP to be compared across countries and over time

# What's wrong with inflation?
]

---
## Prices are messages on scarcity

.pull-left[
### What’s wrong with inflation?

- For people on fixed nominal income (e.g. pensioners, PhD students), higher inflation means lower real value of income.


- Inflation reduces the real value of debt – good for borrowers, bad for creditors.


- High rate of inflation makes the economy work less well: 

  - high inflation is often volatile $\rightarrow$ uncertainty
  - it is harder for producers to distinguish between changes in relative prices and inflation
  - menu costs as firms have to update their prices more frequently
  
]
  
--

.pull-right[
### What’s wrong with deflation?

- When prices are falling, households will postpone consumption (particularly of durables) because they expect goods will be cheaper in the future.
  - This is similar to a negative shock to aggregate demand.

- Deflation increases the real debt burden, which may lead households to cut consumption to return to their target wealth.

# Inflation: conflicting and inconsistent claims on output
]

---
Wages and prices are determined by interactions between firms, consumers, and workers.  

```{r out.width="70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/f9-9-b.png")
```

Thus, inflation is closely related to what happens in the labour market, and then in the goods/services markets.

**Inflation arises from conflicts among economic actors**
]

--

```{r out.width="60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/f15-2a.png")
```

1. **An increase in the bargaining power of firms over their consumers**: This is caused by a reduction in competition, which allows firms to charge a higher markup. It is a downward shift of the price-setting curve.

---
.center[

]

```{r out.width="60%"}

```

2. **An increase in the bargaining power of workers over firms**: This allows them to get a higher wage in return for working hard.

  a. *A shift upward of the wage-setting curve*: The wage they would receive is higher at every level of employment.

2. **An increase in the bargaining power of workers over firms**: This allows them to get a higher wage in return for working hard.

  b. *An increase in the level of employment, moving along the wage-setting curve*: In this case, the wage-setting curve is unchanged.

# Inflation, the business cycle, and the Phillips curve
]

---
## Phillips Curve

```{r out.width="65%"}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/f15-3.png")
```

---
## Phillips Curve

```{r out.width="65%"}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/phillipss-original-curve-wage-inflation-and-unemployment.svg")
```

---
## Inflation and employment

Higher employment may result in inflation.

It increases workers’ bargaining position $\rightarrow$ higher wages $\rightarrow$ higher cost of production $\rightarrow$ higher prices

```{r out.width="55%"}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/phillipss-original-curve-wage-inflation-and-unemployment.svg")
```

---
## Inflation and aggregate demand

An upswing in business cycle is often associated with rising inflation.

--

higher aggregate demand $\rightarrow$  higher employment $\rightarrow$ higher wages $\rightarrow$ higher cost of production $\rightarrow$ higher prices

--

- the economy experiences price and wage inflation, but the **real wage (W/P)** has not increased

- constant real wage means that employment stays high
- ... and the **wage-price** spiral continues

```{r out.width="35%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://media.giphy.com/media/bMycGOQLESDCEnLNUz/giphy.gif")
```

---
## Stable price level

Prices are stable (inflation is 0) when the labour market is in equilibrium.

```{r out.width="70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/f15-4a.png")
```


---
## Labour Market's Wages and Unemployment

```{r out.width="55%"}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/f15-4-b-a.png")
```

If there is labour market equilibrium: The bargaining gap is zero and the price level is constant.

---
## Labour Market's Wages and Unemployment

```{r out.width="55%"}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/f15-4-b-b.png")
```

If unemployment is lower than at the equilibrium: There is a positive bargaining gap and there is inflation.

---
## Labour Market's Wages and Unemployment


```{r out.width="55%"}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/f15-4-b-c.png")
```

If unemployment is higher than at the equilibrium: There is a negative bargaining gap and there is deflation.

---
## Bargaining gap

**Bargaining gap**: The difference between the real wage required to incentivize effort, and the real wage that gives firms enough profits to stay in business.

---
## Inflation-stabilizing rate 

```{r out.width="65%"}

# Monetary policy 
]

---
## Monetary policy 

Monetary policy relies on the central bank being able to control interest rates,
--
 and on changes in interest rates influencing aggregate demand.

--

Fisher's equation:

$$ \textit{Real interest rate} = \textit{Nominal interest rate} – \textit{Inflation rate}$$

$$ r = i – \pi$$
--

Backward induction:

--

1) Choose the desired level of aggregate demand, based on the labour market equilibrium and the Phillips curve

--

2) Estimate the real interest rate, which will produce this level of aggregate demand (using the multiplier model)

--

3) Calculate the nominal policy rate that will produce the appropriate market interest rate


---
## Transmission mechanisms

```{r out.width="70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/f15-14.png")
```

---
## Transmission mechanisms

.pull-left[
### Asset prices

A change in the policy rate has a ripple effect through all the interest rates in the economy. 

When the interest rate goes down, the price of assets goes up (Einstein Unit 10) 

$$ PV = \frac{X}{1 + r} $$

Households who own assets will be wealthier, which will increase their consumption.

]

--

.pull-right[
### Profit expectations

Consistent policymaking and good communication with the public builds confidence in the Central Bank. 

This can lead firms to expect higher demand and therefore increase investment. 

Households may be confident that they will not lose their jobs, and they may increase their consumption.

]

.center2[
# The exchange rate channel of monetary policy
]

---
## Exchange rate


**Exchange rate**: number of units of home currency that can be exchanged for one unit of foreign currency. 

--

$$ \textit{Exchange rate} = \frac{\textit{Home currency}}{USD} $$

--

- When one USD buys more home currency, the home currency is said to have **depreciated**. 

- When one AUD buys more USD, the AUD is said to have **appreciated**.

--

Interest rates affect demand for home currency in the foreign exchange market, so affects the exchange rate (appreciation/depreciation). 

--

Example. Decline in investment demand in Australia.

```{r out.width="70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/f15-16-a.png")
```

---
## Exchange rate as transmission mechanism

A depreciation of the home country’s exchange rate makes their exports cheaper, and imports from abroad more expensive.

---
## Monetary policy limitations

- A country without its own currency does not have its own monetary policy (Eurozone)

--

- **Zero lower bound**: The short-term nominal interest rate (policy rate) cannot go below zero

--

  - When the economy is in a slump, a nominal interest rate of zero may not be low enough to stabilize the economy
  
--

  - **Quantitative Easing**: Central bank purchases of financial assets aimed at increasing investment by reducing yields (Unit 10)

---
## Summary

1) Inflation is caused by bargaining gaps and capacity constraints

--

- Phillips Curve: tradeoff between inflation and unemployment
- Positive bargaining gap leads to persistently high inflation
- The trade-off isn't stable: expectations matter

--

2) Central banks can stabilize the economy by changing the policy rate

--

- 4 channels of monetary transmission mechanism: interest rate, asset prices, profit expectations, exchange rates
- Zero lower bound puts a limitation on monetary policy
