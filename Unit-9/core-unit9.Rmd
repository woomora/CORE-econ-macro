## Employment and prices in the aggregate
]

--

**Real wage**: 
--
  nominal wage divided by the price level (a standard bundle of consumer goods)
  
--

How does the real wage and the level of employment **in the economy as a whole** are determined?

--

1. Each firm decides what wage to pay, what price to charge for its products, and how many people to hire.

--

 - The human resources department determines the nominal wage set by the firm.
 - Given the position of the demand curve, the marketing department then determines the amount of output the firm will sell.
 - The production department then calculates how many employees have to be hired to produce the output determined by the marketing department, based on the firm’s production function.

--

2. Considering the outcome of all the firms’ decisions added together.

```{r, out.width="55%"}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/f9-4-b.png")

At 12% unemployment in the economy, the employee’s reservation wage is low and the worker will put in a high level of effort for a relatively low wage. The firm’s profit-maximizing wage is therefore low.

```{r, out.width="55%"}

At 5% unemployment in the economy, the employee’s reservation wage is high and they will not put in much effort unless the wage is high. The firm’s profit-maximizing wage is therefore higher.

Higher U reduces the reservation wage, because a worker faces a longer expected period of unemployment if he or she loses a job.

This weakens the employees’ bargaining power and shifts the best response curve to the left.

## Profit-maximizing price

The firm then hires a number of employees necessary to produce the quantity of output demanded at that price.

- labour $n$ is the only input
- nominal wage $W$ is the only cost
- $\lambda = 1 \Rightarrow$ one hour of labour produces one unit of output
- $q = n$

$$ \Pi = p \cdot q - W \cdot q = p \cdot n - W \cdot n $$

| **Department** | **... knows** | **… and on this basis sets the firm’s** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Human resources (HR) | Prices, wages and employment in other firms | Nominal wage, *W* |
| Marketing | All of the above and firm’s demand function | Price of output, *p* |
| Production | All of the above, plus labour productivity and amount the firm can sell | Employment, *n* |

Note that $slope_D = \frac{\Delta P}{\Delta Q}$ is the demand's slope
--
$$ \Rightarrow \varepsilon = - \frac{P}{Q} \cdot \frac{1}{slope_D} \iff slope_D = - \frac{P}{Q} \cdot \frac{1}{\varepsilon}$$

 and we know that the firm maximizes its profit when the both demand's and isporfit's slopes are equal.

$$ markup = -\frac{(P - MC)}{Q} = - \frac{P}{Q} \cdot \frac{1}{\varepsilon} \iff markup = \frac{(P - MC)}{P} = \frac{1}{\varepsilon}$$

### Deriving the price-setting curve
]

In our setting, MC is the unit labour cost:

$$\textit{unit labour cost} = \frac{\textit{nominal wage}}{\textit{labour productivity}} = \frac{W}{\lambda}$$

--

Firm choices prices so that the markup ( $\mu$ ) is inversely proportional to the elasticity of the demand curve

$$\mu = \frac{1}{\varepsilon} = \frac{(P-MC)}{P} = \frac{\textit{Profit per unit}}{\textit{Price per unit}}$$
--

$$\mu = \frac{(P- W/\lambda)}{P} = 1 - \frac{W/\lambda}{P}$$

--

Rearrenging 

$$\frac{W/\lambda}{P} = 1 - \mu \iff \frac{W/P}{\lambda} = 1 - \mu$$

$$\iff \frac{W}{P} = \lambda (1 - \mu) = \lambda  - \lambda \mu $$

The firm’s demand for labour depends on the demand for their goods and services (derived demand for labour).

**Aggregate demand** = sum of the demand for all of the goods and services produced in the economy.

The increase in unemployment caused by the fall in aggregate demand is called **demand-deficient unemployment**.

At point B, total involuntary unemployment is given by the sum of cyclical and equilibrium unemployment. Point X is the Nash equilibrium of the labour market, which means that all actors are doing the best they can, given the actions of the other actors. No worker or firm can improve their position by changing their actions.

Point B is not a Nash equilibrium:

- Firms could lower wages without lowering workers’ effort
- Lower wages allow them to cut their prices

The new (lower wage) isoprofit curve passing through the original point B is now steeper than the demand curve, so the firm can do better by lowering its price and moving down the demand curve, selling more.

Point B is not a Nash equilibrium:

- Lower wages allow them to cut their prices

It will continue doing this until it reaches a point on the demand curve where one of the new darker blue isoprofit curves is tangent to the demand curve. The firm maximizes profits at point X.

Real economies don't function so smoothly:

- Workers resist cuts to their nominal wage (strikes)

- Lower wages means people spend less → aggregate demand falls further    

- Falling prices across the economy may lead consumers to postpone their purchases

Remember, the isoprofit curves do not shift when the demand curve shifts. The firm moves on to a new higher isoprofit curve if demand rises as a result of higher economy-wide demand following monetary or fiscal policy actions.

## Labour supply
]

The supply of labour is another important determinant of labour market equilibrium.

--

An increase in labour supply shifts the wage-setting curve downward. Thus, in the short-run:

- greater pool of unemployed
- higher employment rents
- lower cost of effort 

--

Does this sustaines in the medium-run?

At any level of employment there are now more unemployed workers. The rise in unemployment to 1.5 million is shown by distance U′. The threat of job loss is greater and firms can secure effort from the workforce at a lower wage.

```{r, out.width="65%"}

```{r, out.width="65%"}

This causes firms to hire more workers, which requires rising wages along the wage-setting curve. The labour market moves from point B to point C.

Employment and wages rise until they reach the price-setting curve, meaning profits are consistent with market competition again. At point C, employment is 4.5 million workers, the wage is $20, and unemployment has fallen back to 1 million workers, as shown by distance U''

If the union sets the wage, it will be higher than that preferred by the employer, and effort levels correspondingly higher...

Its position above the wage-setting curve depends on the relative bargaining power of the union and the employer.

The bargained wage can be above the wage-setting curve, and, paradoxically, it seems that the union’s success in bargaining would harm workers.

If the employees interpret the employer’s recognition of the trade union, and its willingness to compromise with them over a higher wage, as a sign of goodwill, the best response curve shifts up.

## Summary
]

--

1. Behaviour of firms sets wages and employment in an economy 

  - The wage-setting curve tracks the combinations of wages and unemployment feasible with workers’ effort
  - The price-setting curve determines the real wage corresponding to profit-maximising price

--

2. There will always be involuntary unemployment 

  - Incomplete contracts
  - Deficient demand 

--

3. Labour unions bargain over wages with firms, which affects employment

  - Voice to workers may improve their effort and productivity
